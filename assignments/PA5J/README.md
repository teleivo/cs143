# Programming Assignment: Code generator

This is my implementation of the assignment described in `./README`. The
[PA5.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/handouts/PA4.pdf) contains more details.

I ran my code generator against

TODO update the following

* all valid Cool `.cl` files from all previous assignments
* some more test input of valid `./testdata-ok/` and invalid `./testdata-err/` Cool code
* and the `../../examples/`

Note: you might need to add a `Main` class like this

```
class Main {
	main() : Bool {
		true
	};
};
```

to the example Cool code out there. The semantic analysis will otherwise fail.

To try yourself

* build my semantic analyzer using `make cgen`
* run it
  * against some Cool code using `./mycoolc -o code.s code.cl`
  * against my test samples of valid Cool `./test.sh`
  * against my test samples of invalid Cool `./test-err.sh`
  * against all the course examples `./test.sh ../../examples`

## TODO

* get fibonacci to work
  * implement missing expression like < and if
  * print result in Main?
  * if that works get n from stdin?
  * or print sequence of fibonacci using the Cons from the manual?
* what kinds of tests can I setup to make sure each expression I add is actually working?

* run only my implementation in the `my` case in test.sh

## Limitations and improvements

I took the course suggestion to heart: don't spend much time on optimizing the amount of passes as
there is plenty of logic to get right ðŸ˜…. There is definitely lots of room for improvement!
