# Programming Assignment: Parser

This is my implementation of the assignment described in `./README`. The
[PA2.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/handouts/PA2.pdf) contains more details.

I ran my parser against
* all valid Cool `.cl` files from all
* some more test input of valid `./testdata-ok/` and invalid `./testdata-err/` Cool code
* and the `../../examples/`

To try yourself

* build my parser using `make parser`
* run it
  * against some Cool code using `./myparser code.cl`
  * against my test samples `./test.sh`
  * against all the course examples `./test.sh ../../examples`
