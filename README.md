# CS143 Compilers

This repo contains my solutions to the [CS143 Compilers](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
class assignments in Java.

Try solving them yourself before you peek :grin:.

## Setup

1. Get the Cool Language reference manual and other resources from
   https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143.
2. Get the code like the reference compiler and MIPS simulator from the Stanford Compilers course on
   https://www.edx.org.
3. I did not run the code in a VM as suggested in the edx course.
   https://github.com/afterthat97/cool-compiler helped me in setting up the missing dependencies.
4. I also had to add `./bin/java_cup` with an absolute path to the CUP library. You will need to
   adjust that path.

## Testing

Each assignment

* **PA2J (Lexer)**
* **PA3J (Parser)**
* **PA4J (Semantic Analyzer)**
* **PA5J (Code Generator)**

includes a `test.sh` (some also a `test-err.sh`) script that verify the compiler implementation
against the reference implementation.

The `examples-ok` directory contains additional Cool programs based on the course example code. I've
added useful `main()` methods so the example code is actually running.

## Assignment Numbers

The assignment numbers are offset by 1. Even though the assignment number might be 4 on the website
and or PDF, the directory will be named "PA5J".

## TODO

* try fresh checkout of the project and follow instructions to see if they work
* make repo public

## Limitations and improvements

I took the course suggestion to heart ðŸ˜… There is definitely lots of room for improvement!
> don't spend much time on optimizing the amount of passes as there is plenty of logic to get right

Some improvements I or you :yum: could make
* use proper generics in the CS143 template code like `Enumeration`
* expand the stack in one go for all things that the current activation needs to store instead of
pushing/incrementing every single item
* store local variables in registers before using the stack (register allocation)
* only store local variables that are actually used (dead code elimination)
