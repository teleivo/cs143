# CS143 Compilers

This repo contains my solutions to the [CS143 Compilers](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
class assignments in Java.

Try solving them yourself before you peek :grin:.

## Setup

1. https://github.com/afterthat97/cool-compiler helped me in setting up the missing dependencies.
2. I also had to add `./bin/java_cup` with an absolute path to the CUP library. You will need to
   adjust that path.
