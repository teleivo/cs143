# CS143 Compilers

This repo contains my solutions to the [CS143 Compilers](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
class assignments in Java.

Try solving them yourself before you peek :grin:.

## Setup

1. https://github.com/afterthat97/cool-compiler helped me in setting up the missing dependencies.
2. I also had to add `./bin/java_cup` with an absolute path to the CUP library. You will need to
   adjust that path.

## Assignment Numbers

The assignment numbers are offset by 1. Even though the assignment number might be 4 on the website
and or PDF, the directory will be named "PA5J".

## TODO

* try fresh checkout of the project and follow instructions to see if they work
  * do I only want to include my files? but then I cannot guarantee that I am able to run this in
  the future
* add license from course/uni? at least link to it
* check for any todos
* make repo public
* mention paths and other issues related to not running this in a VM

## License

This repo contains my solutions to the [CS143 Compilers](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
class assignments in Java that relies on code from the course. The code can be obtained from the
Stanford Compilers course on https://www.edx.org/. The license is present in a header in all Java
classes and copied into [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
